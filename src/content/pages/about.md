At Progreso Capital, we believe in a straightforward investment philosophy: double down on what works.

Our expertise lies in direct response marketing—a field where results are measurable, scalable, and repeatable. We seek out businesses that either:

• Already leverage direct response marketing with proven results
• Have untapped potential for direct marketing implementation

## Are You A Good Fit?

We're selective about the businesses we acquire and invest in. Our ideal partners typically have:

• **Revenue**: Annual revenue of $500K-$5M with consistent profitability
• **Growth Potential**: Clear opportunities to scale through enhanced marketing
• **Industry Focus**: Consumer goods, information publishing, or marketing technology
• **Management**: Passionate founders who may want to stay involved or are ready for a smooth transition
• **Market Position**: Established customer base with loyalty and repeat business
• **Operations**: Foundational systems in place, even if they need refinement

We're not looking for distressed businesses or those requiring complete turnarounds. We seek solid foundations where our direct marketing expertise, systems thinking, and team-building experience can accelerate growth to the next level.

We're selective about our investments because we commit fully to the businesses we back. Our goal isn't to build a vast portfolio—it's to create meaningful partnerships where our capital and expertise can drive exceptional growth.
